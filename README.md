Description: 
Computing-Aware Networking (CAN) aims at computing and network resource optimization by steering traffic to appropriate computing resources considering not only routing metric but also computing resource metric and service affiliation.

This Non WG-Forming BoF will discuss the motivation of the work, the principle use cases, problems of existing technologies,  and the potential solutions.

Purpose:
Increase awareness and increase participation in Computing-Aware Networking so that efforts can be organized coherently：
-Overview/update of the state of the industry/SDOs
-Use cases and requirements
-Potential solutions

Goals：
Assess the consensus among participants on the following:
-Are the use cases important?
-Are there existing and sufficient solutions?
-Is this work in Routing area (and which WGs) or somewhere else?
-Is the proposed architecture a good starting point toward a solution?

Agenda：
-Overview and agenda 
-Problem statement, use cases and requirements
  -MEC/CNC Update 
  -Specific Use Cases 
  -Problem statement and requirements
-Potential solutions
  -Architecture of Dynamic Anycast 
  -Others 
-Open discussion 
-Wrap-up

Comments and suggestions are welcome.
